I		   
 felt
		 
		  
good 
    
	 and 	 


	

all
 
 	
 washed
	
 		  	

 	 			
clean		
 
		 	



		of	
	


sin					


	

	
			for 
	


   	

 the		first

	
	time		 
		
  	 I
	   

		had
  			
ever		 	 

 felt	   

	
	 so 



	

 

	

 in
 
	my

 	 
		 	
 life,		 		and
	  

 	I	  


 
	
  

    
	knowed 

	  	I		 	 

  
could 	 	
		
	
 
   


	
pray

 

 


	
now. 	
But 
  I	
didn't  		 	
 

		 	

	 
do	 

 	  	
it	
  	





  straight	 
	
 	  			

				off,	
 
  	  
	 		


 but
   
 
laid
 
 
		 
the
 





		
 paper
	 
 	 
 
	
down
		
 

 



 
  
  and		

   
  

 set  	
	
 
	   
  	 
there			thinking
 

 		  

	  	
thinking 
	
 
 	 
 					
	how	   good	 
  	

	it
 				
	

	was
		all
		this	
 


	
 happened	
  	  	

     	so,	and
 
 	
 	how		 		 
	
 near	
 I	  
  	 	  


 
	  come
to	being	
		lost   and	  	 			


		 		 		going 			 

	

  

	to	 	hell.

		


		
	And		 

went  
on	
		 		thinking.	 
 	 

	
  
 			 
And 
  	
		
got   		to 
	 	

 

 thinking
			
 	
		over	our	  	 	  
    
trip	

		 
	 
	

	

down


 	the	river;		
	   and
I	

see	 	     
	Jim 				


 
 	before	
me		 
 			  	 
all

	
		 
	  the	 		   


 
	 			time:
in 	 	  
  
			
 
 

the	  	
	 

day 

 
  
  

  	and
 

	 	 	 
in
				 
 	  		the		 	 			
	
 			

night-time,
 
	
  
	 
		
	sometimes
  			moonlight,  	


	 	
	

 		 
sometimes 
 
  	 			 
storms,			and	
 
	

 			
  we
			 
	
	
  	
	 
a-floating			
 	
 

	  along,

talking	
 


 




	 and	 singing	  			 		
and	laughing.
But   
 
 	 	

  
 	 	somehow   
  	 
I

 
	   
  	



couldn't 		


	
seem
 
to	


strike 	 	
 
 	  
	
		
 	no
	


places

 
	
 to harden
 	
 	 

	
 	
 me 
against		 	

 	
him, 

 	but


  
only	 

		 
 	

 
	

the	   	other	
 kind.	
  	
	
 			  	 
		
I'd	

 
   		see
 		


		

 	 him
	 standing	 
  			
my 	
	 	
 

 		watch 
	 
on	 
	
		    				
 top	 
	 
	   	 of	
 his'n,

 	

	  
	 
'stead	of			
calling 	
		
 me,  	  	 
 	

 
	 so
		

 		 
   
 I
 
 

					could	 	 
  
		 
go 


	 on

		 
 sleeping;		 	


	and

 
	  	
			
 			 		see	 him
 	


 	      		
how
  
  
		  
		 		
	
glad	

  
	 	 he 	  	was 		



	 	 

when 

  
	  
I		
	
  
 
	
 	
come
	


 back 
 		 	
	
 			

out 	



  of		 	


 


		the
	
fog;
	
   
	
	
 and		 
	 






		when
	  	I
	   		
come


	



         	  to  

 him   	
 	 		 			
 again 
	 	 	
  	 
	in 


			
	 

  	
 
the			

	 swamp,
				   
	 	 			up
 
	    

	there  


 	where  the		 	  		


 	

 
	feud	
 


	 
  	
   was;	 
and  	 such-like

			 			 	times;
		 	 	 
		



	and 	
 	
	

		 
 
would	
 
 


	always   
 
		call	

 		me
	 
	 
 		 honey, 


and
		
 
 


 	


		  
pet	
 
  me 		 
 and
	 	


		



do 
	  
 	
 


 
everything  	he  			  could	think  	
 
 	 	

	
of
 

 for	



	
  

			me,		 




	and	 
 

 
how		good	 	
he		 


			

  

		 
always 
was;

one  

 		 		he's	

 
 
	 
	
  
got	 
	
now; 	  
	 

 	
 	and	   	
 
then

	

I		 
	
happened
 



	 to	 	 		 	
look	 around 
 
			and

   	

 
  
  

 
 see


 	 





 
 that paper.
 
	  			
	 
 
	
	 It 	
was	

	 
 	 a		 	
	  

  
 	close
    place.
		
	     
  
	
 	I  	 		

took 		 

it 


	
	 		 up, 	
 	   	
and 	 	 	 


   held
 	 	

it 
 
	 	 


		


in  		 
		


		 	
	
 my			
hand.	

	

	
 		
  	
	  I
 
 

 was

	 	a-trembling,		
 	
	
 
because	 	
 

	

 					I'd	 		 

				



got
   		
 	

				
to	
	
 		
	
	
 	
	  
decide,		

	 


	  		
forever,
    
				  betwixt
	
 		 		
		 	  	
 two		

	 

	  
	

   	 things,  and		 
		
  

	 	I 
 	
		 	knowed
	  		 
	 it.	
 I


	
	  			  	 	
 studied 
	  
 
 
	 
		a 
			
	

  		  minute, 
 
	
	
 


 	
	

		sort		of  	  
		   
 
	 holding	 	 


	my
		
	  	
	breath, 	  			
 
   

  	  and
then
 says 	 
	  


		 
 

	
to 
   myself:
	 
		
	 "All		right, 	
	 then, 	
	


 I'll  

   



	  	_go_	to	 		
    	hell"

 	
	  		

    			and 		tore  
 it	  	 	    
		
	 up.
