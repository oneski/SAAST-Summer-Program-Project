SAAST Computer Science 2014
Final Project - Microgames!

A collection of student-created microgames created in Python using the Pygame
framework.  A microgame is a short game that lasts 10-15 seconds.  The overall
game strings together random sequences of these microgames to create a
high-action, crazy experience!

Requires Python 2.7 and Pygame installed on your machine.  Run by running
main.py, e.g., at the command line:

python main.py
